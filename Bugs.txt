A bug just happened, when clicking on (0, 0, 0, 0) it set my cursor			Fixed
	to 40 so of course when i press back space the program crashed
	
Need to update letLin when updating the arrayList by adding or				Fixed
	deleting letter. A problem happened when i added more letters than
	there were initially because letLoc has enough variables for the
	initial text only
	
The program does not draw spaces as if they are letter, it just adds		Fixed
	distance between the letter just drawn (last of the old word) and
	the letter about to be drawn (first of a new word).
Can try to change the way spaces are rendered so they are considered a		
	letter. Or can try to find a way to keep text boxes the way they are
	but some how know where the spaces are and adjust to that with letLoc
	This also requires me to have letLoc add extra slots for the spaces.
Because the letter are not drawn they do not get counted into the letLoc
	That is also why for (layer = 0) that letLoc.get(0)[15][0&1] = 0

Mouse cursor placement is working very well, i now need a visible cursor	Fixed
	and need to think about where the cursor goes, if you click on the
	right half of the letter the cursor goes directly in front of the
	letter, but if you click on the left half then have the cursor before
	the letter.
	
The ability to highlight letters (and effect multiple chars at one time)

If you click to the right of line then it crashes.							Fixed

Hitting enter take all the character that are past the cursor and
	bring them to their own array in the arrayList.

/**
 * Error 
 */
	means that i want to put something here that records when that
		error happens.

Add the ability to go up using the arrow keys
	This is tough, is there even really a purpose to this with the layering.
	If i want to install have to take into account the indent.
This would be nice for maneuvering in a single text box.
	You can probably use figures to count 

When the cursor is not on the first row, and if there is a space				Fixed
	(all lines end in a space) at the end of the first line then the
	cursors location is off

Big problem, the way of splitting up words in order to have the words wrap		Fixed
	around from the edge deletes spaces because it uses a delim of "[ ]"
	But when there are multiple of them in a row it saves blank strings in
	the AR's which it then goes and put spaces after the blanks.
All right, maybe this isn't a problem. It seems that it can appropriately
	save the spaces. But it apparently doesn't apply letLoc to them and they
	go off of the edge of the screen.
	The 

I feel like the cursor belongs to the letter left of it. 

Right now there is a space after "for" that isn't being recognized by the letLoc	Fixed

In coversation right after "p to p" the multiple spaces in a row doesnt work 		Done


Click selection doesn work when scrolled

When adding text need to update letLoc, I should just update the text box that
	is being effected. Right before the text is displayed it is Strings in a
	String[][][][]


Should organize the .java by having the inits in a secluded section


put spaces onto the end of letLoc if there is room. 


When i hit space when at the edge (end) of a text box it sends the cursor	Fixed
	to the top left.
Count the number of spaces at the end of the arrayList
	|arraylist.get(arraylist.size-1)| and apply them

Scrolling on the size (click and drag)

For adding extra sections I should change lines to an
	ArrayList<String[][][]>. Can i just add onto the middle of an
	ArrayList? Yes... I need to decide how many sections the new
	string[][][] will have. I should just add one section at a time.
	string[1][0][0]
	then can string[1][0]
	and then string[1]

Open or close all


I think that the ability to click letter isnt tall enought, its only
	16px detection not 18 like the letters are?

Clicking the newly created button (pink) runs CursoLocA.

When minimizing (or maximizing as long as there are txtBoxes below			Fixed
	the [x][0][0][0] by clicking the button it runs drawAll() twice

Can not select the [x][0][0][0] if it is minimized.							Foxed

When folding text does not update cursor

If using a buffer array to add to an array is less intensive then
	using an arrayList all over the place then convert this back to
	using AR's

If you click in a text box at the end of a line and there are no letters
	there the cursor should go to the end of that line not the end of the
	txtBox

Click and drag to highlight.
Double click a word to select the whole word.
Triple click to select the whole line.

FIND WHAT IS THE NUMBER OF LETTERS IN THE LINE SO I CAN SET CURSOR				Done
	TO THE END OF THE LINE IN BUTTONP

Should have an int[][][]AL (or intAL cuz i can 1to4 or 4to1 )of the length
	of every intAr




How to allow the user to add and maneuver new txtBoxes.
	Hold down shift and drag boxes above and below eachother.

If there is no letters in the txtBox then it doesn't get letLoc so cursor
	loc has an error.

Line Break
	have <br> in the text and split the total string into the stringAL

If you scroll repetitivly the speed of scrolling picks up.
	Click and drag side scroll bar for scrolling.

If there is a box that has nothing in it when you save then it forgets
	about that box
If nothing comes out between () (when decompressing) then still add a
	text box

Change the size of the drawn image and instead just have it screen size
	and draw only the shit that is supposed to be on screen


I need to figure out the height of each txt box before i draw the letters.
I should have the first run through the first time and get letter locs.
I just need to remember the number of letter on each txt box a and draw
the correct number of letter on each line straight to a string afterwards.   


	

******* Changeable Shit ********
When you minimize fold the cursor goes to the last letter of the txtBox
	that has everything below minimized.
	
	

	
******** New Shit ***********
What there is to draw
	background
	min/exp buttons
	selected box outline
	txtBoxes
	cursor (in a txt box)


Fucking make commas, apostrophies.
Exclimation marks and dashes

The beginning of txtBox sets char loc. 

How i want scroll to work. in order to not be over-intensive and still be accurate
	Since if it draws every scroll they start to back up and you feel the lag.
	
	
How to make additional layers. Need to add a string (on) and int[] (occ)

if there is no box directly more indented then this box there should be no pink button.

Make injectIntAr adding an int to an int Ar somewhere in the middle. 

dealing with cursor. Adding cursor throught txtBox click. Draw cursor and -1 no cursor.


multTextBox breaks it down from strings with <br> and that code.
i should break down the string that i decompress it. But that forgets about breaks.
How to figure out
from the cursor which char it is at in the on String (which has special chars like "<br>")

Check button click detection.
